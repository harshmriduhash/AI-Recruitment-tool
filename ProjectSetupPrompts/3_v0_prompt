I need your help creating an MVP for an AI powered set of business tools. I would like your help building out the UI for the minimum viable product (MVP). 

I have a few pages, components, and actions already setup. But I need help completing the MVP. I have uploaded a few attachments to the source to help you get oriented with the current state of the project. The README.md contains detailed information about the site design, general architecture, and tech stack. I can upload the various *.tsx files, if that would be helpful?

Once we have the UI looking nice, we will come back and start adding functionality to make the application work. Do you have any questions before we begin?
